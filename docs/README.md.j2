SlimArray is a space efficient, static `uint32` array.
It uses polynomial to compress and store an array.
With a SlimArray with a million sorted number in range `[0, 1000*1000]`,
- a `uint32` requires only **5 bits** (17% of original data);
- compressing a `uint32` takes **110 ns**, e.g., 9 million insert per second;
- reading a `uint32` with `Get()` takes **7 ns**.

# Why

- **Space efficient**: In a sorted array, an elt only takes about **10 bits** to
    store a 32-bit int.

{% include 'docs/stat.md' %}

- **Fast**: `Get()`: 7 ns/op. Building: 110 ns/elt. Run and see the benchmark: `go test . -bench=.`.

- **Adaptive**: It does not require the data to be totally sorted to compress
    it. E.g., SlimArray is perfect to store online user histogram data.

- **Ready for transport**: slimarray is protobuf defined, and has the same structure in memory as
on disk. No cost to load or dump.


# What It Is And What It Is Not

Another space efficient data structure to store uint32 array is trie(Aka prefix
tree or radix tree). It is possible to use bitmap-based btree like structure
to reduce space(very likely in such case it provides higher compression rate).
But it requires the array to be **sorted**.

SlimArray does not have such restriction. It is more adaptive with data
layout. To achieve high compression rate, it only requires the data has a
overall trend, e.g., **roughly sorted**.

Additionally, it also accept duplicated element in the array, which
a bitmap based or tree-like data structure does not allow.

In the [ipv4-list](./example/iplist) example, we feed 450,000 ipv4 to SlimArray.
We see that SlimArray costs as small as gzip-ed data(`2.1 MB vs 2.0 MB`),
while it provides instance access to the data without decompressing it.
And in the [slimstar](./example/slimstar) example, SlimArray memory usage vs gzip-ed data is 832 bytes vs 602 bytes.


# Limitation

- **Static**: slimarray is a static data structure that can not be modified
after creation. Thus slimarray is ideal for a time-series-database, i.e., data
set is huge but never change.

- **32 bits**: currently slimarray supports only one element type `uint32`.
